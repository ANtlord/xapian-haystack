xapian-haystack-1.1.3BETA
=========================

Tagged on January 27, 2010 by David Sauve <dsauve@trapeze.com>

Minor Code Changes
------------------
* Corrected an issue where `site` was not being passed into SearchBackend.
* Corrected an issue with SearchBackend.search that raised an OverFlowError when trying to slice a SearchQueryset.

Known Issues
------------
* `SearchBackend.search` with `highlight=True` converts terms to lowercase in result content.
* `SearchResults` should obey the type of data chosen in their corresponding field in the `SearchIndex` if present
* `__startswith` filter is highly inefficient, especially with large data-sets.
* MultiValueFields should not store data in the value column of the index
* SearchQuery doesn't handle multiple exclude attributes correctly
